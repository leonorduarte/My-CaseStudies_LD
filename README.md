## About
Hi, I’m Leonor! I have a strong academic foundation in Management and Marketing Intelligence and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data-Driven Marketing. My passion lies in combining data analytics and strategic insights to solve real-world problems. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the fields of data science and project management as an entry-level data specialist and project leader.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex datasets and developed a knack for identifying patterns and actionable insights. I’ve also gained hands-on experience in data visualization, statistical analysis, and workflow optimization, which I believe are key assets in supporting impactful decision-making. Certifications like the IBM Data Science Specialization and Scrum Master further complement my skills.
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## W2E

The W2E – Water to Evolution project focuses on tackling the global problem of access to clean drinking water. Our solution is a portable purifier powered by advanced UV technology.
**As the team leader, I helped guide the project’s planning and execution to make sure everything stayed on track.**
### Description
> We started by digging into market research to understand what people actually need. It became clear there was strong interest in clean water solutions from outdoor enthusiasts, urban communities, and health-conscious individuals. These insights helped shape the purifier’s design, prioritizing effectiveness, portability, and sustainability.
From there, we built a business model that included both direct sales and a subscription service for filter replacements. To make the product more appealing, we added perks like subscriber-only promotions and newsletters, and even explored partnerships with outdoor brands and health organizations to reach a wider audience.
For marketing, we leaned into the purifier’s sustainability and health benefits. Social media became a big part of our strategy, connecting us with potential customers and showing how the product makes a difference. We also organized workshops to raise awareness about clean water and teamed up with influencers to spread the word.
As part of the project, we developed an operational plan to outline how the launch could be executed. This included predictions for sourcing sustainable materials, subcontracting production, and creating a logistics framework to ensure efficient delivery.
On the financial side, we prepared projections and conducted a break-even analysis to set realistic sales targets. Funding options, such as grants and crowdfunding, were also explored as potential ways to support the hypothetical launch.
