## About
Hi, I’m Leonor! I have a strong academic foundation in Management and Marketing Intelligence and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data-Driven Marketing. My passion lies in combining data analytics and strategic insights to solve real-world problems. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the fields of data science and project management as an entry-level data specialist and project leader.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex datasets and developed a knack for identifying patterns and actionable insights. I’ve also gained hands-on experience in data visualization, statistical analysis, and workflow optimization, which I believe are key assets in supporting impactful decision-making. Certifications like the IBM Data Science Specialization and Scrum Master further complement my skills.
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
